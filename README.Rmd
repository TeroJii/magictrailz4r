# magictrailz4r

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of magictrailz4r is to ...

## TO-DO

- [x] Add a function to unnest json data
- [ ] Consider adding a function for user_properties
- [x] Function for building session_id
  -  [ ] add tests with test data
- [ ] Function for fixing timestamp
- [ ] Other function for visualization
- [ ] Add mock data to the package

## Installation

You can install the development version of magictrailz4r from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("TeroJii/magictrailz4r")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(magictrailz4r)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.
